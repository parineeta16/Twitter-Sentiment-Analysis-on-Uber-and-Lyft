I've heard too many Uber drivers heading back and robbing the place.  I found Uber is really only convenient for traveling around a big city. If you are outside of the city it costs a bit more.  We have used them for trips and they were wonderful.  No communication, no worrying about tips and no chance of being dropped off at the wrong location due to the language barrier.  The app does all that for you and all you do is tap for a pick up request. Thank god for Google Maps.I prefer them over our local taxi cab drivers as most of them scare the hell out of us. Local taxi cab drives drive insanely fast, do unethical/safe maneuvers while driving, or turn the meter off (which is illegal in any state) and start shouting flat fee rates.  If this ever happens to you ask them to let you out where you are.

AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Uber. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Uber. I tried to call Uber when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: ""Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox"". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those cocky bastards that Uber has plenty of.2. Uber VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Uber and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Uber phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem.That's a big flaw. I called Uber automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Uber website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Uber poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Uber has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again. 3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Uber because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Uber has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Uber cars, or banged up Uber cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems.In contrast, Lyft has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness.4. I do not care about the negative press that Uber has had. However, I do care very much about:- the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL- the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS.- your having an ACTUAL customer service.

Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn.

I told them to remove the charge from my card, but they said that was ""against their policy"". I have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them, and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellation...but I don't know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy. Seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refund...which wouldn't qualify as a ""policy"". I guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple $5 cancellation.

In my experience drivers refuse to contact their customers, they lack any ounce of hospitably, Ive seen cabs on my map literally pass right by me, are too lazy to find me or even make a U-turn. Despite the address I input some drivers will get lazy and drop me off at the wrong spot or a block away from my stop. Some drivers are either to old, lazy or stupid to know how GPS works, which cause locations errors most driver do not want to make up for, for a lot of errors drivers make I ""the customer"" have to compensate for. Uber's refund system is a joke! If a driver cancel a trip the cancel fee comes out of my pocket! And when I report it they give me credit (not an issue) but I want my real money they toke back! Their rating system is adorably useless, because regardless how many one stars a driver gets whats the point if you can't report the driver on their $#*!ty service or better, make a complaint, I've seen drivers that treat me like crap with five or four stars!?. I'm from NY and a lot of drivers are not American therefore theres a big broken English barrier, try explaining a location to someone who doesn't understand you or vice versa. The only reason I ever use uber is literally because Lyft has error issues on my phone, Lyft is also cheaper with nicer drivers, while uber is the Kwik-E-Mart of cab services.
